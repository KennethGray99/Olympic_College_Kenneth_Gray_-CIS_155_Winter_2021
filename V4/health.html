        <h2>Allergies</h2>
            <p class="info">
            Allergies become common during Summer season, or areas residing in warmer climate areas. The allergies involved in a Shiba Inu are runny or swollen eyes, sneezing,
            atopy. The common symptoms that may appear with allergies is constant ear infections, rubbing of the face, and licking paws. Some of these symptoms may potentially be 
            fleas. It's good to make sure that the Shiba Inu is living in a clean sanitary environment.
            </p>
        <h2>Obesity</h2>    
            <p class="info">                
            Being active and exercise is essential in keeping the Shiba Inu healthy and away from being obesity. A minimum of one hour of exercise everyday is needed for the Shiba Inu,
            though the more exercise the better. Not enough exercise may lead them to unhealthy lifestyles that can result in constant barking and obesity.
            </p>
        <h2>Glaucoma</h2>
            <p class="info">
            A disease that's vulnerable to the eyes. Glaucoma slowly destroys the nerves in the eyes through the build up of fluids on the eyes. The severity of glaucoma may vary
            and can be treated. Blindness can become a factor if glaucoma isn't treated at all or properly. Eye drops are available to reduce the amount of fluid build up onto 
            the Shiba Inus eyes. Though it is advised to make a trip to the vet to get the Shiba evaluated.
            </p>
        <h2>Cataracts</h2>
            <p class="info">
            Cataracts is another health concern to the Shiba Inus eyes. Cataracts will appear to older Shibas and can cause a cloudy appearance on the eyes that will affect their vision.
            Surgeries can be done to relieve the cloudy appearance to restore their vision.
            </p>
        <h2>Hypothyroidism</h2>
            <p class="info">
            When the thyroid doesn't develop properly, it may lead to hypothyroidism. This will directly affect the Shiba Inus metabolism and can cause them to become obese, hair loss,
            behavioral changes. A trip to the vet is needed and can be solved through medication. If hypothyroidism is left untreated, then this may lead to serious issues for the 
            Shiba Inu.
